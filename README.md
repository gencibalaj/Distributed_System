# Distributed_System
This is a project part of "Distributed Systems" Class. I was one of five contributors in this project.
This is a platform (Distributed System) like Zoom or Google Meet wich we can use to video chat with others.
How it Works? If you want to start a video call, you have to create a room and then send room code to others who want to join. Or if you just want to join in others room than you need room code to be part of the room.
